Very basic bootstrapper for Flask applications.

Requires python (obviously) and vagrant

Steps to use:

1)  git clone <blahblah>
2)  "cd" into the directory
3)  ./initialize.sh <name you want for the project>

The initialize script will then replace all instances of PROJECTNAME in the code with your chosen project name.
It will also download and startup a vagrant postgres dev box (from http://www.pgdevbox.com/) and create a db named after the project
